# Stable Marriage Problem in Lean

Formalizing the stable marriage problem and the Gale-Shapley algorithm in Lean. See the famous paper [College admissions and the stability of marriage](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~billey/classes/562.winter.2018/articles/Gale.Shapley.pdf) by Gale and Shapley (1962) for an extremely readable introduction to the problem.

You may also enjoy _Two-Sided Matching: A Study in Game-Theoretic Modeling and Analysis_ by Roth and Sotomayor (1990) for a more rigorous theoretical treatment of the problem and its many extensions (e.g., Gale-Shapley do not consider incomplete preferences, whereas this is covered in Roth-Sotomayor, and indeed this formalization uses that setup).

## Project organization

- `StableMarriageLean/Basic.lean`: core definitions (preferences, matchings, stability).
- `StableMarriageLean/GaleShapley.lean`: Gale-Shapley state machine and algorithm.
- `StableMarriageLean/Lemmas.lean`: supporting lemmas and invariants.
- `StableMarriageLean/Properties.lean`: main results about termination and stability.
- `StableMarriageLean.lean`: root module that re-exports the library.
- `Main.lean`: small entry point for the executable.

## Theory

### 1. Agents and Preferences

We have two disjoint finite sets:

- $M$: men
- $W$: women

Each agent $a \in M \cup W$ has a **strict preference ordering** over a _subset_ of the opposite side (i.e., preferences are incomplete -- in other words, it is not a total order). Each man $m$ has a preference ordering $P_m$ and each woman $w$ has a preference ordering $P_w$. We will denote "prefers to" by $\succ$, indexed by the agent when needed. We do not consider ties here, although there is a generalization to ties in the literature.

### 2. Acceptability

A pair $(m, w) \in M \times W$ is **acceptable** iff:

$$
w \in P_m \quad \text{and} \quad m \in P_w
$$

If either side does not list the other, the pair is **unacceptable**.

Unacceptable partners are treated as **worse than being unmatched**.

### 3. Matchings

A **matching** $\mu$ is a partial function:

$$
\mu : M \cup W \to M \cup W \cup \{\varnothing\}
$$

such that:

- $\mu(m) \in W \cup \{\varnothing\}$
- $\mu(w) \in M \cup \{\varnothing\}$
- $\mu(m) = w \iff \mu(w) = m$ (consistency)
- Each agent is matched with **at most one** partner

Agents mapped to $\varnothing$ are **unmatched**.

In Lean, we represent a matching as two functions (menMatches and womenMatches),
and add a consistency predicate to recover this single-function view.

### 4. Individual Rationality

A matching $\mu$ is **individually rational** iff:

$$
\forall a,\; \mu(a) \in P_a \cup \{\varnothing\}
$$

In other words, no agent is matched to an unacceptable partner.

### 5. Preference Over Being Unmatched

For every agent $a$:

$$
\text{any acceptable partner } \succ \varnothing
$$

Being unmatched is worse than any acceptable match.

### 6. Blocking Pairs

A pair $(m, w)$ is a **blocking pair** for a matching $\mu$ iff:

1. $(m, w)$ is acceptable
2. $m$ prefers $w$ to $\mu(m)$
3. $w$ prefers $m$ to $\mu(w)$

Formally:

$$
w \succ_m \mu(m) \quad \text{and} \quad m \succ_w \mu(w)
$$

This includes cases where one or both agents are currently unmatched.

### 7. Stability

A matching $\mu$ is **stable** iff:

1. It is **consistent**,
2. It is **individually rational**, and
3. It has **no blocking pairs**
